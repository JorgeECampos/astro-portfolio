        "d": "The GUI interaction and data must be coupled with the graphical interface"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A is correct. It must be designed for learnability, maintainability, and performance. B is incorrect; not all manual tests can or should be automated. C is incorrect; the code could be self-documenting but the entire SUT would not be. D is incorrect; automation is easier with decoupling."

      "question_number": 3,
      "points": 3,
      "learning_objective": "ALTA-E-2.1.1 (K4) Analyze a system under test to determine the appropriate automation solution",
      "question_text": "You are deciding on the functional test automation approach for a highly complex system which is expected to be used in production for many years. You have already conducted a survey with the major tool vendors and you have determined that you will not be able to use any of their tools to create your test automation due to the non-standard interfaces that were required for the software. You and the developers have decided that your best automation approach will be through custom interfaces implemented specifically for testing. What are two concerns you should have with this approach? (Pick 2)",
      "options": {
        "a": "If the interfaces are not disabled before release, there could be a security risk",
        "b": "The performance of the test interfaces may be much faster than the performance of the real interfaces",
        "c": "The effort spent to develop test automation will not be justified by the expected lifespan of the code in production",
        "d": "Because there is a high level of intrusion, there may be false alarms generated",
        "e": "Because there is a low level of intrusion, the test results will not be representative of the production code"
      },
      "correct_answer": ["a", "d"],
      "explanation": "A and D are correct. A is noted in section 3.2.3 of the syllabus where it talks about checking for security risks if you leave test interfaces in place. D is correct because developing custom test interfaces is considered a high level of intrusion and this may generate false alarms due to the different code being exercised. B is not correct because we are testing the code, not the performance. C is not correct because it is stated in the question that this is a long-lived, complex product. E is not correct because the custom interfaces introduce a high level of intrusion."

      "points": 3,
      "learning_objective": "ALTA-E-2.1.1 (K4) Analyze a system under test to determine the appropriate automation solution",
      "question_text": "You have been automating a legacy application that provides critical functionality to the business. An update to the legacy system has been approved and the developers plan to use third party software to provide the new functionality. The third party software has already been tested but the interface between the existing software and the new software is problematic. Your existing test automation needs to be extended to test the interface between these two products. How should you approach implementing the best automation solution?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Develop test automation for the entire system including the legacy and third party applications",
        "b": "Investigate if automation is possible via the APIs used to interface with the third party software",

        "d": "Investigate if automation can be implemented using the CLI to replace the existing GUI automation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "B is correct; if APIs are available automation at the API level makes sense. A is incorrect; there is no reason to fully automate the testing of the third party system. C is incorrect; we are not testing the GUI of the third party software. D is incorrect; this is not a logical approach."

      "learning_objective": "ALTA-E-2.2.1 (K4) Analyze test automation tools for a given project and report technical findings and recommendations",
      "question_text": "You are evaluating functional test automation tools. The tool that you prefer can provide your organization with a favorable cost-benefit ratio, which appeals to senior management. Additionally, you feel the tool is superior in meeting your other technical criteria. However, the tool has many features most of which will never be used. As a result, you feel this makes the tool overly complex and confusing. What should your next steps be regarding selection of this tool?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Consider another tool that is more user friendly",
        "b": "Explore the possibility of configuring the tool to turn off unnecessary features",

        "d": "Consider acquiring an additional tool that can provide a more user friendly interface to the preferred tool"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "B is correct; tools are often configurable and allow functionality to be hidden. A is incorrect; the preferred tool meets your criteria, finding another tool may be difficult. C is incorrect; training sessions take away from testing time and the need for training would continue for the life of the tool, which would be an expensive alternative. D is incorrect; additional tool costs, configuration, and maintenance would make this an unacceptable alternative."

        "b": "Controllability",
        "c": "Maintainability",
        "d": "Interoperability"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A is correct. A system that allows visibility to the results of a test has the property of observability. B is not correct because controllability is the ability of the interface to control behavior of the system. C and D are not correct because they are quality characteristics rather than specific testability characteristics."

        "d": "Test Flexibility Layer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "C is correct; it supports generating test cases from models of the SUT and manual test case design. A is incorrect; it provides the interface between the test automation and the SUT. B is incorrect; it may specify test cases but does not generate test cases. D is incorrect; this is not part of the gTAA structure."

      "question_number": 9,
      "points": 3,
      "learning_objective": "ALTA-E-3.2.1 (K4) Design the appropriate TAA for a given project",
      "question_text": "You are working on the design of a test automation project. The gTAA was set up by a consulting company prior to your being hired. You are now looking to create the TAA from the gTAA. You have the following requirements that must be addressed by your TAA: 1. The TAA must support independence across technologies. It is likely that this same test suite will be used in different test environments and on different target technologies 2. The test artifacts need to be portable 3. Vendor-neutrality is preferable 4. It is vitally important that the TAA be maintainable and maintenance costs be minimized 5. It is preferred that less technical people be able to maintain the system even though highly technical people have built it 6. There is a large project budget for this effort for the next two years, but the budget will decrease after that time. Given these requirements, which one of the following should the TAE consider during the implementation of the TAA?",
      "options": {
        "a": "The communication protocols used by the TAS to interact with the SUT",
        "b": "The number of automated test cases to be maintained by the system",
        "c": "The test roles that will be supported by the implementation",
        "d": "The use of abstraction in the implementation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "D is correct. Abstraction will likely be needed to accomplish the stated goals. A, B, and C are incorrect; while these are certainly considerations for the implementation of the TAA, they will not help address the stated goals."

        "b": "The test definition can be completed without knowledge of the tool that will be used for execution",
        "c": "The execution will be able to add test cases to the test definition as needed during execution",
        "d": "The test definition layer will supply the adaptation necessary for the tests to run with various tools and interfaces"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "B is correct; by separating the definition from the execution, the definition is immune from the tool selection and usage. If another tool is used, the definition doesn't have to change – only the execution layer will change. See section 3.1.1. A is incorrect; separating the two does not have anything to do with speed of execution. C is incorrect; test cases are not added during execution. D is incorrect; adaptation is supplied by the adaptation layer."

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "C is correct. This will allow building on the structured scripting that has already been done and the libraries that have been created while automating the business processes. A is incorrect; this is not a real scripting type. B is incorrect; this could feed into the process-driven scripting, but C is more complete. D is incorrect; it is referring to a more basic type of scripting and it has already been specified that structured scripting has been done."
