> “The best SDLC is the one teams actually use.”

At ITJ, I joined an environment where multiple teams worked at different speeds and maturity levels. My mission: create a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework that was **clear enough to guide**, but **flexible enough to adopt**.

---

## 🧭 Why SDLC Matters
A well-defined SDLC isn’t about bureaucracy — it’s about **shared language** and **traceability**:
- Everyone knows where code is coming from and where it’s going.
- Requirements → code → validation becomes measurable.
- Onboarding new engineers is faster and safer.

## ⚙️ What We Rolled Out
Our approach focused on building habits, not just rules.

### 🔀 Branching & Versioning
We introduced a **branching strategy** that aligned with feature lifecycles, ensuring predictability across repos.

### 👀 Code Review
A **risk-based checklist** encouraged thoughtful reviews — balancing quality and velocity.

### 🚦 CI/CD Gates
Automated **validation steps** were added to pipelines: linting, test coverage, and artifact verification.

### 📝 Release Notes Templates
Each release linked tickets to commits, generating instant audit evidence (SOC 2 / ISO 27001).

## 📈 Results
- **Fewer rollbacks** and faster recoveries.  
- **Auditable processes** with traceable commits.  
- **Clear ownership** at every stage — from requirements to validation.

## 💡 Key Takeaway
Start small.  
Define the **minimum viable SDLC** — the one that your teams will actually use — and evolve from there.  
Policies are powerful when they enable collaboration, not when they slow it down.
